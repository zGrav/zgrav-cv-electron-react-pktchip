# zgrav-cv-electron-react-pktchip

#### What does this do and why did I build it?
I was bored and I decided to build a very small React app that acts as an introduction/CV of me pairing using Electron/Webpack 4 and run it on my PocketCHIP.

I also built this so I could annoy people at the upcoming PwC Developer Day :)

I might redo something more fancy later when I read up on graphics and build a 'demo'.
